# Poseidon-The-Water-Saver
Poseidon is an easy to make Low Cost Wireless Water Tank Overflow Control System made using the Arduino UNO board and HC-12 wireless communication module.
<b>This device turns off the water pump when the water level in the overhead tank reaches a certain level and turns it on automatically
when the tank gets empty.</b> This is done wirelessly using two HC-12(one at sender end(tank) and the other at receiver end(water pump)) 
module connected to an Arduino UNO board each which is the brain of the organization. The water level is measured using an Ultrasonic 
Sensor placed on the lid of the tank.

You also get a call as a notification after the motor is switched ON/OFF.
